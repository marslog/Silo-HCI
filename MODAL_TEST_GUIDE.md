# 🧪 File Browser Modal - Testing Steps

## Problem
Modal opens but shows "Empty Storage" dialog instead of the file browser with folder list.

## Solution: Test Modal Capability

### Step 1: Hard Refresh
- Go to: https://192.168.0.200/storage.php
- Press: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Step 2: Open Console  
- Press: `F12`
- Click: **Console** tab

### Step 3: Look for Test Button
- Scroll down on the page to "Create New Storage" section
- You should see a yellow button: **🧪 TEST: Show Modal with Test Data**
- Click it

### Expected Result
- A white modal box should appear in center of screen
- It should contain a table with 2 folders:
  - 📁 sdb
  - 📁 storage

If this works ✅ → The modal HTML and CSS are fine
If this doesn't work ❌ → There's a CSS/display problem

## Alternative: Test in Console

Copy-paste this into console and press Enter:
```javascript
testFullModalFlow()
```

You should see logs like:
```
✓ Step 1: Found modal
✓ Step 2: Modal displayed
✓ Step 3: Found tbody
✓ Step 4: Tbody populated with test data
✅ TEST COMPLETE - Modal should show 2 folders above
```

## If Test Works But Browse Folder Doesn't

Then the issue is in `loadDirectoryContents()` function. Test it:

```javascript
loadDirectoryContents('/mnt')
```

Watch console for logs like:
```
📂 loadDirectoryContents STARTED
🌐 FETCHING API
✅ FETCH SUCCEEDED
📨 API RESPONSE
Success: true
Data length: 2
🎨 RENDERING TABLE
✅ TABLE RENDERED
```

If any step fails, copy the error message.

## Screenshots to Send

Please provide:
1. Screenshot of yellow test button (confirm it exists)
2. Screenshot after clicking test button (does modal appear?)
3. Console output when clicking test button
4. Console output when clicking "Browse Folder"

This will help identify exactly where the problem is.
